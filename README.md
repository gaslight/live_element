# LiveElement

This is an experiment in live server side rendered custom elements. It started as literal copy of 
the Phoenix LiveView code with the changes necessary to make it possible for custom element to attach 
to a LiveElement (something like a LiveView) and render. 

As such, most of the code here is originally [Phoenix LiveView](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view), and all credit goes to them for their excellent work. 
Thanks for making this possibly crazy experiment possible.
